        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently a full time student at University of California, Riveride, I have minimal but substantial job experience. I am currently working at a restaurant chain called Farmer Boys, which can be mostly found in Southern California, and my role is a Server/Cashier. I have currently been working at the locale for 10 months, and I have also been recently promoted to Shift Leader. The role of a shift leader is to make sure that everyone is doing their job, nothing is disorganized, as well as having the task of opening/closing the restaurant. While it is a very grueling task, it has helped me gain leadership skills and organizations skills, especially when under high amounts of stress. While working, I am also a full time student in college, and am planning on concentrating in Marketing as a Business Major. Along with the leadership skills I have gained through working at a fast food restaurant, I have also great customer support skills and excellent service skills, which I believe would provide usefulness for the concentration I am planning on studying. I also have experience in Digital Arts, as that was a course I took in High School. Along with being a outstanding leader and team worker, I am also fluent in Spanish, and am planning on learning French. As for my background, I was born in Lima, Peru and moved here when I was 3 years old. My family and I grew up relatively below middle class, however due to the constant willingness for my dad not to give up, he now has a dental office in Ontario. I have seen the inner workings of keeping a business alive, and I believe that would also provide useful for companies that are ambitious. Due to my family moving here, the transition to a different culture was quite drastic, therefore I had to develop social skills early on, which are skills I still have now. In the workplace my determination and ability to motivate others around me would provide useful to create a positive environment.  <br><br>
